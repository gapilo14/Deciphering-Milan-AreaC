# Behind the Gates: Deciphering Milan’s Area C Traffic DNA

## 📌 Project Overview
Behind the Gates is an in-depth data science exploration of Milan's Area C, a restricted traffic zone (ZTL) aimed at reducing congestion and pollution in the city center. By analyzing years of entry data, this project aims to uncover the "DNA" of urban mobility—identifying temporal patterns, the impact of public policies, and the behavior of different vehicle categories.
The analysis follows a structured pipeline from raw data acquisition to quantitative and qualitative modeling.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
The project is divided into six logical chapters, each represented by a detailed report:
- `00 - Project Introduction`: Contextualization of Area C, project objectives, and high-level research questions
- `01 - Data Preparation`: Data cleaning, handling missing values, merging datasets, and feature engineering
- `02 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`: Visualizing traffic flows, seasonality, peak hours, and gate-specific behaviors using descriptive techniques
- `03 - Quantitative Analysis`: Statistical modeling, time-series decomposition, and trend analysis to quantify traffic drivers.
- `04 - Qualitative Analysis`: Classification tasks for EDA confirmation and further analysis (environemnt, residents...)
- `05 - Conclusions`: Summary of findings, policy implications and answers to original questions.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Temporal Dynamics: Identification of clear "rush hour" peaks and the significant variance between weekday commercial traffic and weekend leisure traffic.
- Policy Impact: Analysis of how changes in Area C regulations influenced entry volumes.
- Environmental Trends: Tracking the evolution of the vehicle fleet entering the city.
- Location Influence: Identification of main the main gates and contextualization.
